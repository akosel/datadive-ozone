      <p>
        These visualizations are for the 2014 A2 DataDive. The Ozone House wants to have a better understanding of
        how their call data has changed over the years. We have a series of research questions we asked as a part
        of the DataDive. Visualizations associated with a research question (see below), have a number in their
        title
      </p>
      <ol>
          <li>Does the call volume increase during certain times of day?</li>
          <li>Does the call volume increase during certain times of the year?</li>
          <li>What months show the highest call volume?</li>
          <li>What are the primary "presenting issues" of the caller?</li>
          <li>Does anxiety level decrease between the start of the call and end of the call?</li>
          <li>Is end anxiety level affected by the formulation of a safety plan?</li>
          <li>Are there months in which certain presenting issues are more common than in other times of the year?</li>
          <li>Are there annual trends around the prevalence of some presenting issues?</li>
          <li>What percentage of calls with Immediate Safety Concerns have Safety Plans made?</li>
          <li>Are there any trends over time regarding how Crisis Line callers learned about Ozone House?</li>
        </ol>
