A2 DataDive 2014 -- Ozone House
==============


## Getting Started
To get started with this file, you need node installed. Once you have that, you can run npm install to get all of the dependencies for the project. Finally, you can run 'node app.js' in the root folder, and it will spin up a local server listening on port 8000. Alternatively, you can see a live demo at http://ozonedatadive.herokuapp.com/

## What is this?
This is a visualization dashboard created for the Ozone House. As part of the A2DataDive, our team was tasked with providing an education track for participants. As a part of our preparation we came up with a number of research questions based on the needs of our client. The visualizations included in the dashboard our there to help gain insight into those questions.
